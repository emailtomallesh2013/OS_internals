1.  

I have one processor and four cores within it.
Each coe will be having one cpu and can run one program at a time.

2. How many CPU sockets, cores, and processors does your machine have?
   I have 1 CPU socket 4 cores and one processor.

3. What is the frequency of each processor?
   2.20GHz or 2207.998MHz

4. How much memory does your machine have?
   8142292 kB or 8 GB  ( I have allocated this to my virtual machine)  

5. How much of it is free and available? What is the difference between them?

MemTotal:        8142292 kB
MemFree:         5724160 kB
MemAvailable:    7016180 kB

Free memory is the amount of memory that is currently not used for anything. It can be considered as wasted memory. 

Available memory is the amount of memory that is available for allocation to new or existing processes. Available memory is then an estimation of how much memory is available for use without swapping.

6. What is the total number of user-level processes in the system?
76 as seen below. ps -u <username> lists processes in username. wc -l counts number of lines in output. (one line per process).

purvi@purvi-VirtualBox:~/OS_Submissions/Week1_solutions/week1_warmup/linux$ ps -u purvi | wc -l
76

7. What is the total number of number of forks since the boot in the system ?
11296 as seen lbelow. vmstat -f gives total number of forks since reboot.
purvi@purvi-VirtualBox:~/OS_Submissions/Week1_solutions/week1_warmup/linux$ vmstat -f
        11296 forks
purvi@purvi-VirtualBox:~/OS_Submissions/Week1_solutions/week1_warmup/linux$ 

8. How many context switches has the system performed since bootup?
   We need to sum up all voluntary and non voluntary context switches in /proc/<pid>/status over all pids to get final number of context switches.

voluntary_ctxt_switches:        7941
nonvoluntary_ctxt_switches:     1126
